    <h3>About:</h3>
        <Summary>Sung Jin-Woo is a young man with an unassuming appearance that belies his incredible strength. Standing at average height with a lean but muscular build, he has sharp, piercing eyes that glow a deep blue when he taps into his immense power. His jet-black hair is slightly tousled, adding to his laid-back yet determined look. Clad in dark, sleek clothing often complemented by a long, shadowy coat, he exudes an aura of quiet confidence and mystery.
            <br><br>
            Despite his humble beginnings as the "world's weakest hunter," Sung Jin-Woo's journey through relentless battles and near-death experiences has transformed him into the ultimate hunter—a man who commands shadows and can summon powerful entities to fight by his side. With a stoic demeanor, he remains calm under pressure, always strategizing his next move. However, beneath his composed exterior lies a strong sense of duty and a fierce determination to protect those he cares about.</Summary>
